<br>This app shows the current weather information for a location of your choice and a 3 hour forecast for the next 5 days.<br>
It makes use of OpenWeatherMap API (https://openweathermap.org/api) to retrieve the weather data and it also uses Flickr API to download a geolocalised image shown as a wallpaper every time a city is selected.<br>
The city can be selected via the autocomplete search widget provided by the Google Places API (results are filtered and only cities will be shown).<br><br>
